## Problem Definition

A Shopify theme that users can choose different layouts and set up the store for them with a single click.
We may also want to implement a Chat GPT type of service, where users are able to tell the theme what kind of store they want and the theme will auto-set up the store for them.

Ease of use, usability, and web accessibility are the main priorities.
