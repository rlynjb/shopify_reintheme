## Problem Definition

A Shopify theme that users can choose different layouts and sets up the store for them with a single click.
We may also want to implement Chat GPT type of service, where users are able to tell the theme what kind of store they want and the theme will auto-setup the store for them.
Ease of use, usability, and web accessibility are main priority.
We may also need to implement Vue store or react. Some kind of headless ecommerce system to easily keep tech stack up to date with latest tech, easily integrate with mobile shopping and 3rd party services, and solve performance issues.
